🧠 Algmali ADB Link — Execute ADB Commands from One Android to Another (No PC, No Root)
Algmali ADB Link is a simple but powerful method that enables any Android device to send ADB commands to another Android device without root and without using a computer. It combines existing Android apps and hardware (like OTG) in a new way to create a direct ADB bridge between two devices.

🚀 Features
🔌 Run ADB commands from one phone to another via USB-C cable.

🧱 No root required on either device.

💻 No need for a computer.

📱 Useful for phone technicians, testers, modders, and advanced users.

⚙️ Works with any ADB-compatible Android device.

🧰 Requirements
Device Role	Requirements
Sender Device (acts like PC)	Android device with ADB client app (e.g. Termux + ADB binaries, LADB, WebADB)
Receiver Device (target)	USB debugging enabled, authorized, connected via USB-C or OTG
Hardware	USB-C to USB-C cable, or USB-A to OTG adapter + cable

🧪 How It Works
Connect both devices via USB-C to USB-C (or OTG + USB-A to C).

Open the ADB client app on the sender device (like Termux or LADB).

Verify the connection (adb devices) — the target device should appear.

Run your desired ADB commands (e.g. adb shell, adb install, adb push, etc.).

Done — full ADB control without a computer.

📷 Example Use Case
bash
نسخ
تحرير
adb devices
adb shell settings put global airplane_mode_on 1
adb shell am broadcast -a android.intent.action.AIRPLANE_MODE
✅ Why It Matters
Most Android-to-Android ADB setups require:

Root access ❌

Developer tools ❌

Advanced configuration ❌

This method removes all that. You just need:

A USB cable

A few free apps

Your brain 🧠

🔐 Security Note
Always confirm USB authorization on the target device. Avoid using this method with untrusted apps or third-party ADB wrappers.
